Once upon a time there was a girl who, though of humble origin, was so incredibly beautiful that she was famed throughout the region. Knowing
how much the young men of the Kingdom liked her, she rejected all her suitors, waiting for the arrival of some handsome Prince. Well, it
didn’t take long for a handsome Prince to come by, and as soon as he saw the young girl he fell for her and showered her with compliments and
gifts. The wedding was extravagant, and everyone said they made the perfect couple.

However, when the shine and excitement of the presents and the parties began to wear off, the young Princess found out that her handsome
young husband wasn’t as wonderful as she had expected. He behaved like a tyrant towards his people, he boasted about his wife as though she
was a hunting trophy, and he was selfish and mean. When she came to see that everything about her husband was a false appearance, she didn’t
hesitate to tell him this to his face, but he answered her back in a similar vein, reminding her that he had only chosen her for her beauty,
and that she could have chosen many others rather than himself, if she hadn’t let herself be carried away by ambition and her desire to live
in a palace.
